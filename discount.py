#Create a function named calculate_discount(price, discount_percent) that calculates the final price after applying a discount. The function should take the original price (price) and the discount percentage (discount_percent) as parameters. If the discount is 20% or higher, apply the discount; otherwise, return the original price.

def calculate_discount(price, discount_percent):
    if discount_percent >= 20:
        discount_amount = price * (discount_percent / 100)
        final_price = price - discount_amount
        return final_price
    else:
        return  price
    
# Example usage:
price = float(input('Enter price: '))
discount_percent=float(input('Enter discount percent value: '))
print(calculate_discount(price,discount_percent))
